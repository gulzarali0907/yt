        <h1>HI Welcome To This Turtorial</h1>
        <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally made by Markus "Notch" Persson. It was run by a company called Mojang Studios before being sold to Microsoft in 2014 for 2.5 billion American dollars.[18] It is the best-selling video game of all time, and over 238 million copies of the game have been sold.[19]

            In Minecraft, players explore a free walkable world filled with various 3D items. Many of these items are cubes, called "blocks". These include basic terrain and resources such as dirt, stone, wood, and sand. There are also items the player can use, such as crafting tables, furnaces, blast furnaces, looms, stonecutters and other interactable blocks. Players can use these to make new items such as tools and armor, as well as different kinds of blocks.[20] Players can then build structures using these blocks, such as buildings, statues, pixel art, and more.
            
            Minecraft has a large community. It has a lot of user-generated content like mods, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new gameplay mechanics and game modes to the base game.
            
            Minecraft has three versions: Java, Bedrock, and Education Edition. Java is the original version of Minecraft, but Bedrock is now more used due to it being multi-platform. Bedrock Edition and Education Edition are written in C++ and Java Edition is written in Java.
